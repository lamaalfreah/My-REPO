My name is Lama Alfreah. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Taibah University with First-Class Honors and ranked among the top 10 students. I’m passionate about technology and building real-world solutions. I’ve worked on several projects, including one focused on AI and web development. I'm currently training at Tuwaiq Academy to improve my web development skills using Python. I'm always eager to learn and grow in this field.
