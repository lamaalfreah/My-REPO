Ambitions and Dreams
I dream of becoming a leading developer who creates meaningful and impactful technology that makes peopleâ€™s lives easier. My ambition is to continue learning, explore new areas in AI and web development, and one day lead innovative projects that contribute to society. I also hope to inspire more young women to pursue careers in technology and believe in their potential.
